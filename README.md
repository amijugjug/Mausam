# Mausam

<h3> <strong>Mausam</strong> is a weather prediction desktop application.</h3></br>
<p>
   This application is build in Java.</br>
   It is a raw implementation of supervised machine learning algorithm.</br>
   I used <strong>Neural Networks</strong> to predict the weather provided on a dataset.</br>
</p>
<h3> Key Points </h3>
<p>
    1. It uses BackPropagation Algorithm to correct the output.</br>
    2. One can choose the number of hidden layers between the input and output layer of Neural Networks.</br>
    3. JFrame is used to show the output on screen.</br>
    4. Output is shown in terms of graph.</br>
    5. Whole things are based on class architecure hence a concrete example of how OOPs work could also be found.</br>
</p>
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<p>
  1. Fundamentals of core java.</br>
  2. JFrame Framework of java to show a graphical output.</br>
  3. Knowledge of Neural Networks and Backpropagation Algorithm.</br>

<h3>Thanks Giving</h3>
<p>
  I would like to thanks my project partners <strong>Mr. Kanhaiya Kumar</strong> and <strong>Mr. Sovan Mondal</strong> for helping me out throughout the project.
